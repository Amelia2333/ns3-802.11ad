        WLAN IEEE 802.11ad Model in ns-3, Version 0.2
        ---------------------------------------------

Introduction:
-------------
This is a repository for the development of WLAN IEEE 802.11ad model in ns-3. 
The implemented model supports the following features:

1. DMG Channel Access Periods (BTI/A-BFT/ATI/DTI with both CBAP and Service Periods).
2. Beamforming Training (BT) in BHI and DTI.
3. Abstract DMG PHY layer for DMG CTRL/SC/OFDM.
4. Fast Session Transfer (FST) Mechanism.
5. DMG Relay Support (Full Duplex).
6. DMG PLCP Model for 802.11ad frame.
7. 60 GHz Directional Antenna Model.

The implementation is based on the available model of WLAN IEEE 802.11 in ns-3. 
The following paper includes a background on IEEE 802.11ad, implementation details,
and evaluation section for this model. If you use our model in your research,

Project Road-map:
-----------------
We are planning to develop and add the following features to the project:

1. Half Duplex DMG Relay Support.
2. Fast Link Adaptation.
3. Dynamic Channel Allocation (Polling).
4. Reverse Direction Protocol (RDP).
5. Statistical Channel Model + Raytracing Model for Millimeter-Wave Band.
6. Beamformed Link Maintenance.
7. Decntralized Clustering.
8. Spatial Sharing.

If you are willing to work on one of the previous features, we are happy to collaborate.



Building The Project:
---------------------
The current implementation is based on ns3-26. In order to save time and evaluate the IEEE 802.11ad model only, type the following command:

./waf configure --disable-examples --disable-tests --disable-python --enable-modules='applications','core','internet','point-to-point','wifi'
./waf build

The previous command builds the required models only to run IEEE 802.11ad with its provided scripts in debug mode. 

To build the project in optimized mode for fast execution type the following command:

./waf configure --disable-examples --disable-tests --disable-python --enable-modules='applications','core','internet','point-to-point','wifi' --enable-static -d optimized
./waf build
Running Scripts:

The project includes different scripts located in scratch folder to test the previous listed features and mechanisms. 
At the beginning of each script, there is a some regarding the simulated scenario (network topology + expected output + usage description).



Bug Reporting:
---------------------
In case of a bug is encountered during the usage of the original model, please report the problem
to the following email address (hany.assasa@gmail.com). In the email, please include the following:

1. Simulation file with small description on the simulated scenario and the expected output.
2. Exact run parameters which caused the simulation to crash.

Please do not report any problem related to your own modification of the original code.
